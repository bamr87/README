Level Goal
----------
There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org/home/bandit30-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit30-git` is the same as for the user `bandit30`.

From your local machine (not the OverTheWire machine!), clone the repository and find the password for the next level. This needs git installed locally on your machine.


Commands you may need to solve this level

### What this level teaches

That Git stores more than files and branches, including tags and other references.

### Key ideas

- **Tags** are permanent labels on a specific commit, usually marking releases such as `v1.0`.
- **Annotated tags** can carry a message of their own.
- **`git tag`** lists them and `git show TAG` displays what each points to.
- **Searching a repo.** When files and logs reveal nothing, enumerate every kind of reference Git keeps.

### How to approach it

1. Clone the repository and check the visible files and log.
2. List the tags in the repository and inspect them.

### Why it matters

Secrets can hide in the less obvious corners of a repository, which is why secret-scanning tools search all references, not just the latest files.
