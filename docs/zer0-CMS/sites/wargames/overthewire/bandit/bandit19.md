Level Goal
----------
The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

Commands you may need to solve this level
-----------------------------------------
ssh, ls, cat

**Level map:** logged in as `bandit18`, find the password for `bandit19`.

### What this level teaches

That an SSH login is not the only way to run something on a server, and what shell startup files do.

### Key ideas

- **`.bashrc`.** A script that bash reads when it starts, used to customise your shell. Whoever controls it controls what happens at login, and attackers abuse that for persistence.
- **Interactive vs command mode.** `ssh user@host` opens an interactive shell, but `ssh user@host COMMAND` runs one command and returns.
- Read the argument description in `man ssh` to see how the command is passed.

### How to approach it

1. Try logging in normally and observe what the modified `.bashrc` does.
2. Use the remote-command form of ssh to run `ls` first, then `cat` the file the Level Goal mentions.

### Why it matters

Automation tools such as Ansible, deployment scripts and Git over SSH all run commands remotely this way.
