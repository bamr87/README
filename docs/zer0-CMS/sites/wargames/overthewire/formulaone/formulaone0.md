There is no information for this level, intentionally.

## Study guide

<div class="sg-map" markdown="1">
**Level map:** the account for this page is `formulaone0`; the index tells you levels are accounts named `formulaone0`, `formulaone1` and so on.
</div>

### What to expect

Upstream states "There is no information for this level, intentionally." That is part of the game: you discover what the level does by investigating it. FormulaOne is another wargame rescued from intruded.net. Its index gives very little away beyond where to connect.

### Where it fits

FormulaOne is not given a difficulty rating in its index, and lives under `/formulaone/` on the game server (SSH port 2232). This is page 1 of 7 in this mirror. Treat the first level as orientation: learn the account layout, the data directory and the tools available before looking for a bug.

### How to approach it

1. Start with `file` and `strings` on the level's program to learn what it is and what text it contains.
2. Check permissions with `ls -l`: a setuid or setgid bit tells you whose privileges the program runs with.
3. The index says the source code for the first level can be read by logging in to a different wargame hosted on the same server, and that figuring out which one is your first task.
4. Write down the one thing the program assumes about its input, then test what happens when that assumption is false.

### Why it matters

Each level is a miniature version of a real bug class. Working it out yourself without hints builds the investigative habits that no walkthrough can give you.
