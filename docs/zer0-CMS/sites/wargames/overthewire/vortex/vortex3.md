A Stack Overflow with a Difference
----------------------------------
This level is pretty straight forward. Just sit down and understand what the code is doing. Your shellcode will require a setuid(LEVEL4\_UID) since bash drops effective privileges. You could alternatively write a quick setuid(geteuid()) wrapper around bash.

**NOTE:** ctors/dtors might no longer be writable, although this level is compiled with *-Wl,-z,norelro*. Lookup some information about this e.g. [here][]

### What this level teaches

Writing shellcode that survives dropped privileges, and understanding binary hardening flags.

### Key ideas

- **Bash drops privilege.** The page notes that bash drops effective privileges, so your shellcode needs to call `setuid` itself, or you can use a tiny wrapper that does `setuid(geteuid())`.
- **ctors and dtors.** Old writable tables of constructors and destructors were classic overwrite targets.
- **Relocation hardening.** The level is compiled without full relocation read-only (`norelro`), yet the page notes the tables might no longer be writable; research why.
- **Reading.** "Smashing the Stack" and "Bypassing StackGuard and StackShield" are linked.

### How to approach it

1. Read the code until you can say what it does line by line.
2. Decide which overwrite target will work on this system, and verify it in `gdb`.
3. Write shellcode that sets the right user ID before starting a shell.

### Why it matters

Privilege handling in shells and the evolution of mitigations like RELRO explain why old exploit recipes stop working.
