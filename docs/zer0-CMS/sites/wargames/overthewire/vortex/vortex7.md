Checksum Fun
------------
This level requires CRC\_32(argv[1], strlen(argv[1])) to be 0xe1ca95ee. You might need to extract the crc tables from the program.

### What this level teaches

How CRC checksums work and why they can be forged.

### Key ideas

- **The requirement.** The CRC-32 of the program's first argument must equal a specific 32-bit value shown on the page.
- **CRC tables.** The program uses a lookup table you may need to extract from the binary.
- **Linearity.** CRCs are linear over a finite field, so you can compute bytes that force any result, which is impossible with a proper cryptographic hash.
- **Reading.** "CRC and How to Reverse It" is linked.

### How to approach it

1. Learn how a table-driven CRC-32 is computed.
2. Choose how many free bytes you will append or choose and solve for them.
3. Verify your answer with an independent CRC implementation.

### Why it matters

CRCs detect accidental errors, not tampering. Never use them for integrity against an attacker.
