## Study guide

<div class="sg-map" markdown="1">
**Level map:** logged in as `vortex8`, obtain access to `vortex9`.
</div>

### What this level teaches

Static analysis of a small dynamically linked program.

### Key ideas

- **Dynamic linking.** Library calls go through the procedure linkage table; tools like `ltrace` show them at run time.
- **Static plus dynamic.** Read the disassembly and confirm your reading by running the program under a tracer or debugger.
- **Reading.** The page links a reverse-engineering primer.

### How to approach it

1. Run `file`, `strings` and `ltrace` to form a first impression.
2. Disassemble `main` and follow the control flow to the success path.
3. Work out the input that reaches it.

### Why it matters

Small reversing tasks build the pattern recognition used for every larger binary you will face.
