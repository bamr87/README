### What this level teaches

Choosing the right technique yourself, after seeing several in earlier levels.

### Key ideas

- **Diagnose first.** Ask which memory-safety bug is present before choosing an attack.
- **Use the debugger.** `gdb` shows registers, the stack and memory around your input, which is faster than guessing.
- **Pointer-based bugs.** Programs that copy data through pointers may let a small mistake in one place write somewhere unexpected.
- **Keep notes.** By now you have a toolbox; write which tool fits which symptom.

### How to approach it

1. Read the source twice, slowly, and annotate every pointer and buffer.
2. Run it under `gdb` with normal input and note what lives where.
3. Change one thing at a time until the program does something it should not.

### Why it matters

Real vulnerability hunting is exactly this: reading code and choosing the right primitive.
