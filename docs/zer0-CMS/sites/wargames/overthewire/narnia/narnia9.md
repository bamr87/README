## Study guide

<div class="sg-map" markdown="1">
**Level map:** logged in as `narnia9`. This is the highest-numbered Narnia page; the upstream index counts ten levels, `narnia0` to `narnia9`.
</div>

### What this level teaches

Putting the whole Narnia toolbox together without a hint about which technique to use.

### Key ideas

- **Diagnose before attacking.** Read the source, identify the unsafe operation, and decide whether you are looking at an overflow, a format string, a pointer problem or something else.
- **Use all your tools.** `gdb` for layout, `objdump` or `ghidra` for the compiled view, and a short script for building payloads.
- **Check what the goal is.** As in earlier levels, the program is setuid to another user; reading that user's file under `/etc/narnia_pass/` is the objective.

### How to approach it

1. Read the source carefully and annotate it.
2. Reproduce a crash or unexpected behaviour before writing any exploit.
3. Build the payload in small, tested steps.

### What to do next

- **Re-derive one earlier exploit from scratch** using only the source and `gdb`.
- **Move on to Behemoth.** From the [games index](../../), Behemoth is the next step; it does not hand you source code.
- **Learn the defences.** Read about stack canaries, non-executable memory and address randomisation to see why today's exploits are harder.
