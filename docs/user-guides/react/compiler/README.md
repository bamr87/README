# React Compiler

React Compiler is a compiler that optimizes React applications, ensuring that only the minimal parts of components and hooks will re-render when state changes. The compiler also validates that components and hooks follow the Rules of React.

More information about the design and architecture of the compiler are covered in the [Design Goals](./docs/DESIGN_GOALS.md).

More information about developing the compiler itself is covered in the [Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).
