# Advanced Features

This section covers some of the more advanced features you'll encounter in Bashcrawl.

## Combat

The combat system in Bashcrawl is designed to teach you about process management. You'll use commands like `ps`, `kill`, and `./script` to defeat monsters.

## Puzzles

Some rooms contain puzzles that require you to use your knowledge of the command line to solve them. These puzzles may involve file manipulation, searching for hidden files, or using advanced commands.

## Scripting

As you progress, you'll learn to write your own shell scripts to automate tasks and solve problems.
