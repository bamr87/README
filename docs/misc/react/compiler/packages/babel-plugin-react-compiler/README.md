# babel-plugin-react-compiler

React Compiler is a compiler that optimizes React applications, ensuring that only the minimal parts of components and hooks will re-render when state changes. The compiler also validates that components and hooks follow the Rules of React.

This package contains the React Compiler Babel plugin use in projects that make use of Babel. You can find instructions for using this plugin here: https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler
