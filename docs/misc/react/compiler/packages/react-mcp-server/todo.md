TODO

- [ ] If code doesnt compile, read diagnostics and try again
- [ ] Provide detailed examples in assistant prompt (use another LLM to generate good prompts, iterate from there)
- [ ] Provide more tools for working with HIR/AST (eg so we can prompt it to try and optimize code via HIR, which it can then translate back into user code changes)
