## Virtual Filesystem Structure

```
/ (root)
├── home/
│   └── hero/
│       ├── readme.txt ("Welcome to Terminal Illness! Use 'help' to see commands.")
│       └── workshop/ (created during Quest 4)
│           └── notes.txt (created during Quest 5)
├── forest/
│   └── scroll.txt ("Whispers: The 'pwd' spell reveals your place in the realm.")
└── dungeon/ (empty)
```

## All Available Commands

### Core Commands
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `ls [path]` - List directory contents
- `cd <path>` - Change directory
- `mkdir <name>` - Create directory
- `touch <name>` - Create/update file
- `cat <file>` - Display file contents
- `grep <pattern> <file>` - Search for text in file

### Utility Commands
- `help` - Show all available commands
- `merlin` - Get contextual hints from companion
- `save` - Manually save progress
- `load` - Manually load progress
- `exit` - Exit game (auto-saves)

## Alternative Paths & Strategies

### Speedrun Path (Minimal Commands)
```
pwd → ls → cd /home/hero → mkdir workshop → cd workshop → touch notes.txt → cat notes.txt → cd /forest → grep Whisper scroll.txt
```

### Exploration Path (Learn Filesystem)
```
pwd → ls → ls /home → ls /forest → cat /home/hero/readme.txt → cat /forest/scroll.txt → cd /home → cd hero → mkdir test → touch test.txt → cat test.txt → cd /forest → grep pwd scroll.txt
```

### Error Learning Path (Try Wrong Commands)
- Try `pwd` with arguments (shows usage)
- Try `cd` to non-existent directory
- Try `cat` on directory
- Try `grep` with wrong syntax

## Merlin Hint System

Merlin provides contextual help based on current quest:

- **Quest 1**: "Type 'pwd' and press Enter to reveal your current location."
- **Quest 2**: "Use 'ls' to list items here. Try 'ls /forest'."
- **Quest 3**: "Travel with 'cd path', e.g., 'cd /home/hero'."
- **Quest 4**: "Conjure a place with 'mkdir name' while at the desired location."
- **Quest 5**: "Create a file with 'touch notes.txt'."
- **Quest 6**: "Reveal contents with 'cat file.txt'."
- **Quest 7**: "Seek words in a file: grep word file.txt"

## Game Modes

### Classic Mode (Default)
- Structured 7-quest progression
- Fixed learning path
- Guaranteed completion

### Dynamic Mode (Preview)
- AI-generated quests (currently stubbed)
- Variable difficulty
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

## Save/Load System

### Automatic Saving
- Progress saves after each quest completion
- Saves on exit (Ctrl+C or `exit` command)
- Save file: `.ti_save.json`

### Manual Save/Load
- `save` - Force save current progress
- `load` - Reload from save file

### Reset Game
```bash
rm -f .ti_save.json
```

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Command Errors
- **Unknown commands**: "Unknown command: xyz. Try 'help'."
- **Wrong arguments**: Specific error messages per command
- **File not found**: Clear error for missing files/directories

### Filesystem Edge Cases
- **Root navigation**: `cd /` or `cd ..` from root stays at `/`
- **Empty files**: `cat` on empty file shows nothing
- **Existing paths**: `mkdir` and `touch` succeed silently on existing items
- **Relative paths**: All commands support relative and absolute paths

### Quest Logic
- **Location requirements**: Some quests require specific directories
- **Command prerequisites**: Must learn required commands first
- **Completion order**: Quests must be completed sequentially

## Achievement System

### XP Rewards
- Basic quests: 50 XP
- Advanced quests: 100 XP
- Final quest: 150 XP
- **Total possible**: 550 XP

### Ribbons & Rewards
- Navigation Novice (Quest 1)
- Glimmering lens (Quest 2)
- Pathwalker's charm (Quest 3)
- Builder's sigil (Quest 4)
- Scribe's quill (Quest 5)
- Reader's sigil (Quest 6)
- Whisperer's token (Quest 7)

## Advanced Features

### Tab Completion
- Command completion: Type first letters + Tab
- Path completion: Auto-complete file/directory names
- Context-aware: Suggests relevant items

### Command History
- Up/Down arrows to navigate previous commands
- Persistent across sessions
- Search with Ctrl+R

### Session Logging
- All commands and outputs logged
- Used for debugging and progress tracking
- Stored in game state
