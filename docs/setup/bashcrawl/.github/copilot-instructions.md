# Bashcrawl Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

Bashcrawl is an educational text-based adventure game that teaches terminal/shell commands through immersive gameplay. The codebase is structured as an interactive learning environment where directories represent game rooms and executable files are interactive encounters.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Front Matter: Educational Metadata for Game Development

Front matter in Bashcrawl serves as educational context that enables AI agents to understand the learning objectives, game mechanics, and terminal concepts being taught. Each file uses structured metadata to communicate its role in the overall learning journey.

#### Educational Front Matter Elements

- **Learning Objectives**: Clear statements of what terminal skills the content teaches
- **Game Mechanics**: How the content integrates with inventory, progression, and discovery systems
- **Skill Prerequisites**: What knowledge players need before engaging with this content
- **Terminal Commands**: Specific commands and concepts being demonstrated
- **Fantasy Context**: How the content fits within the adventure theme and narrative

#### Front Matter Structure for Educational Content

```markdown
---

---
```

### Directory-as-Room Structure
- Each directory represents a game room/chamber with specific learning objectives
- `entrance/` → `cellar/` → `armoury/` → `chamber/` represents progressive skill building
- Hidden directories (`.vault`, `.chapel`, `.rift`) unlock after collecting specific treasures
- Use descriptive directory names that reinforce the fantasy theme while teaching file navigation

### Educational Content Files with Front Matter
- **`scroll` files**: Markdown documentation with educational front matter teaching specific terminal concepts
- **Executable files** (`treasure`, `potion`, etc.): Interactive bash scripts with embedded front matter demonstrating commands
- **`README.md` files**: Comprehensive guides with front matter outlining learning paths for each major area
- All content follows fantasy/RPG metaphors enhanced by front matter narrative context

#### Front Matter for Interactive Scripts

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Educational Front Matter for Interactive Bashcrawl Script
#

```

#### Front Matter for Learning Documentation

```markdown
---
# Educational Front Matter for Bashcrawl Documentation
title: "The Scroll of Advanced Text Processing"
description: "Master grep, sed, and awk through ancient text manipulation"
learning_objectives:
  - "Use grep for pattern matching and search"
  - "Apply sed for stream editing and text transformation"
  - "Implement awk for advanced text processing"
game_mechanics:
  type: "scroll"
  unlocks: ["text_wizard_chamber", "advanced_scripting_area"]
  requires_items: ["basic_commands_knowledge", "file_navigation_mastery"]
  teaches_commands: ["grep", "sed", "awk", "cut", "sort"]
skill_level: "advanced"
prerequisites:
  - "Comfortable with basic file operations"
  - "Understanding of regular expressions helpful"
  - "Experience with pipes and redirection"
fantasy_theme:
  role: "Ancient tome of text magic"
  setting: "Scholar's chamber in the tower"
  narrative: "Unlocks the secrets of text manipulation sorcery"
progression_path:
  previous: ["file_operations_scroll", "basic_commands_scroll"]
  next: ["shell_scripting_grimoire", "automation_spells"]
ai_teaching_notes:
  - "Start with simple grep examples"
  - "Build complexity gradually with sed"
  - "Use practical, relatable text examples"
  - "Emphasize real-world applications"
---
```

### Game Mechanics Implementation

#### Inventory System
```bash
export I=item,\$I           # Add item to comma-separated inventory
echo \$I                    # Display current inventory
grep item <<< \$I           # Check if item exists in inventory
```

#### Room Unlocking Pattern
```bash
mv ../hidden_room ../visible_room 2>/dev/null
```
Hidden directories (prefixed with `.`) become visible after treasure collection.

#### Interactive Executables
All executable files follow this pattern:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Educational comment explaining the concept
# Game logic checking prerequisites
# Output teaching specific terminal skills
```

## Content Creation Standards

export I=""                # Reset inventory
./treasure                 # Test executable interactions
ls -F                      # Verify file type indicators
```

### Adding New Rooms
1. Create directory structure following existing patterns
2. Add `scroll` file with educational content
3. Create interactive executables with proper permissions (`chmod +x`)
4. Add unlock mechanism in prerequisite rooms
5. Test complete learning path

### Content Validation
- Verify all markdown follows game formatting conventions
- Test executable scripts work in different shell environments
- Ensure progressive difficulty curve is maintained
- Check that real terminal skills map to fantasy metaphors

## Project-Specific Conventions

### File Naming
- `scroll`: Primary educational content (markdown)
- `treasure`: Inventory/progression mechanics
- `potion`, `spell`, `ghost`: Themed interactive encounters
- Avoid generic names; use fantasy terms that hint at functionality

### Permission Management
- Executables must have `+x` permissions for game mechanics
- Use `ls -F` patterns throughout to teach file type recognition
- Hidden files (`.filename`) used for game state and unlockable content

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Use POSIX-compatible commands (avoid GNU-specific flags)
- Test on macOS and Linux environments
- Provide alternative command examples when platform differences exist

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- Git for distribution (GitHub/GitLab hosting)
- Standard POSIX shell tools (no exotic dependencies)
- Binder for online play without installation

### Learning Path Integration
- Game maps to real-world development workflows
- Each room teaches transferable terminal skills
- Scaffolds from basic navigation to advanced shell scripting
- Connects to broader IT education goals

When modifying this codebase, maintain the educational integrity while enhancing the adventure experience through comprehensive front matter documentation. Every change should teach something valuable about terminal/shell usage and be guided by clear learning objectives, game mechanics, and fantasy context defined in front matter.
