#### 🛠️ Essential Terminal Basics Before You Begin

**Navigation Commands:**

```bash
pwd                 # Print Working Directory - shows exactly where you are
ls                  # List - shows all files and folders in current location
ls -la              # List with details - shows hidden files, permissions, dates
cd ..               # Go up one directory level (like clicking "back")
cd ~                # Go to your home directory
cd /                # Go to the root directory of your system
```

**File Viewing Commands:**

```bash
cat filename        # Display entire file contents at once
less filename       # View file contents page by page (press 'q' to quit)
head filename       # Show first 10 lines of a file
tail filename       # Show last 10 lines of a file
wc filename         # Word count - shows lines, words, and characters
```

**Getting Help:**

```bash
man command         # Manual page for any command (press 'q' to exit)
command --help      # Quick help for most commands
which command       # Shows where a command is located
history             # Shows your recent command history
```

**File and Directory Operations:**

```bash
mkdir dirname       # Create a new directory
touch filename      # Create a new empty file
cp source dest      # Copy file or directory
mv old new          # Move/rename file or directory
rm filename         # Delete a file (be careful!)
rmdir dirname       # Delete an empty directory
```

#### 🎯 Pro Tips for New Terminal Users

**Command Shortcuts:**

- **Tab Completion**: Press `Tab` to auto-complete file/directory names
- **Up Arrow**: Scroll through previous commands
- **Ctrl + C**: Stop a running command
- **Ctrl + L**: Clear the terminal screen (same as `clear` command)
- **Ctrl + A**: Jump to beginning of current line
- **Ctrl + E**: Jump to end of current line

**Safety First:**

- Always know where you are with `pwd` before running commands
- Use `ls` to see what's in a directory before acting
- Be extra careful with `rm` (delete) commands - there's no recycle bin!
- When in doubt, use `--help` or `man` to understand a command

## 🔮 For Those Who Seek to Transcend Mortal Limitations

*"In shadows deep, where none dare tread,
Lies knowledge vast for those with dread.
The path is hidden, dark and steep,
For terminal souls who secrets keep."*

### 🗝️ The Riddle of the Ancient Codex

Brave warrior, legends speak of an **Ancient Codex of Terminal Mastery** hidden within these very catacombs. Only those who possess the wisdom to look beyond the visible realm can hope to discover its location.

The ancient prophecy speaks thus:

```
🔍 "Seek ye the file that starts with naught but dot,
    Where 'ancient' and 'codex' in the name are caught.
    In the realm's very root, it lies concealed,
    To those who know how hidden truths are revealed."

📜 "When found, invoke its power with the shell,
    And witness secrets that few can tell.
    But know this, seeker of forbidden lore:
    Only the worthy shall unlock this door."

⚔️ "The path requires no complex art,
    Just knowledge of how hidden files start.
    Execute with bash what you discover there,
    And ascend beyond what mortals dare."
```

### 🎯 Cryptic Hints for the Initiated

For those whose terminal mastery runs deep, these whispered clues may guide your quest:

- **The Location**: *"Not in depths below, but in the realm's foundation..."*

Only those who can answer these challenges may be ready for the Codex:

1. **Shadow Walker**: Can you list files that begin with darkness itself?
2. **Pattern Seeker**: Do you know the incantation to find files by name?
3. **Ancient Invoker**: Can you breathe life into executable scrolls?
4. **Root Explorer**: Do you understand the difference between relative and absolute paths?
