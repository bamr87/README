## Activation

The intelligent help system can be activated in several ways:

### Method 1: Direct Execution
```bash

../help                 # From any subdirectory
```

### Method 2: Source the Alias
```bash
source .help_alias      # Enables 'help' command for the session
help                    # Now you can use the help command
```

### Method 3: Automatic (if .functions is sourced)
```bash
source entrance/.functions  # Loads all game functions including help
help                       # Help command is now available
```
